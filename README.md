and train a machine learning model using the training set that performs well on the
validation set. You should decide on the metrics of "performance" yourself, We will assess
your decision.
It is up to you to use any of the following languages: [Python, Scala, Java, R]. We
appreciate a small write up of the observations and your thoughts to follow your thought
process.
## Bonus points if you can design and create a microservice that will serve predictions of that model.
